Description
-----------

This course applies the concepts of reaction rate, stoichiometry and equilibrium to the analysis of chemical and biological reacting systems. Derivation of rate expressions from reaction mechanisms and equilibrium or steady state assumptions. Design of chemical and biochemical reactors via synthesis of chemical kinetics, transport phenomena, and mass and energy balances. Topics in this course include: chemical/biochemical pathways; enzymatic, pathway, and cell growth kinetics; batch, plug flow and well-stirred reactors for chemical reactions and cultivations of microorganisms and mammalian cells; heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis; heat and mass transport in reactors, including diffusion to and within catalyst particles and cells or immobilized enzymes.

Recitation Sections
-------------------

The purpose of the recitation section is to give you practice working difficult problems in a supportive environment, with a focus on moving from the problem statement to solvable systems of equations. We will also review homework solutions, discuss problem solving strategies, answer questions concerning lecture material, and discuss exam solutions. You must have read and thought about the homework problems before you come to recitation. Be prepared to be asked to do problems on the chalkboard.

Grading
-------

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Homework | 20% |
| Quiz | 10% |
| Midterm exam 1 | 15% |
| Midterm exam 2 | 20% |
| Final exam | 35% 

### Homework

Weekly problem sets will be assigned approximately 6-7 days in advance of their due date. They will be graded and returned the following week. **Homework policy and honor code**: While students are encouraged to discuss problem solutions and strategies, they are expected to work individually in arriving at solutions. Electronically copying or cutting and pasting any section of another student's homework will be considered cheating and will lead to disciplinary action against both the copier and any student who made the electronic version available before the due date. Please do each problem on separate and stapled sheets with your name on it. Homework is normally due at the end of class on Wednesdays. Late homework will be accepted until 10 pm of the date it is due in a box outside one of the TAs' offices. 50% of the grade will be deducted from late homework unless there are extenuating circumstances that justify the late submission. Solutions to problem sets will be provided at 10 pm on the due date.

### Quizzes

Unannounced quizzes on the material presented in class or assigned for reading during the previous class. One quiz can be missed or dropped from grading. Most quizzes will be given during recitations.

### Exams

The first two exams will be 1 hour long and will be given during class time. The third exam will be given during the final exam period and will be three hours long.
