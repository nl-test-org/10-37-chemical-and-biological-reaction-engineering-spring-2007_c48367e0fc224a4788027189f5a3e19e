description: A review of some of the concepts of heat and mass transfer, particularly
  focusing on the dynamics at the interface between two disparate materials, such
  as the boundary of a solid particle submerged in a fluid. In the cases considered,
  the interface is stationary and there is no phase change or chemical reaction at
  the interface.
